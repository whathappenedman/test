notes:
yove been loney you whole life.
and you family never filled that either
in fact you felt more alone there.
on top of that your intelligent and then were always out of place in reagrds
to peers. no surprise you are very depressed.

the only time in life you were eager to wake up consistently is when you had someone
to wake up for. sometimes i dont want to wake up but omar calls and i come to life.

you add in your eye issues and your dick issue you are insecure and lonely
perfect recipep for depression.

then lets talk about validation. its so rare. never has it come from family.
very rarely from friends? because you dont have any close friedns?

reboot and being out of shape make this worse.

i can fail my reboot any more that and smoking perpetuated this
how will i have a happy life if my dick and mind is mush from reboot.
itll take months of reboot with vigours excercise and postivive
neuro health behaviours (positive affimation, making new pathways)
to undo and fix. so i have to commit.

ican stop reboot and get in shape. nothing is stoping me. 
except food. if it comes to that. just need to cook your own food.

get job and vision, speech, dental. 
you could have done this long time ago and been happy.
okay not 2010 but at least 2016? ok not then bu 2018?
it all is because of reboot.
no more.
then excercise and try to loose weight and posture
and for lonely need quran and fajr.
