everyone helps on lore/qa/community
3-5 heads/story/art
so 15 local 150k + 1% upto 1mil cap paid over next 6 years of employment. 
probably will work on 2 more gammes min and more moeny too so double cap to 2 and two games 4.
thats 2.5 mil, round out to 4 for over seas team
can double it so 30,200 for 10mil/yr total, over kill 
can drop 60+30+60+30 = 180/36 = $5/month. need one mil a month in income so 200k sales/custommers.
