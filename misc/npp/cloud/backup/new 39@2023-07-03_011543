# peering

for every pop have 1 gbps syemmetrical can do text,image,audio cdn.
then get peering with (att, comcast, CHARTER) (tmobile, verizon starlink) and 
also with backbone so ix points and normal datacenters.

so pic a dc with ix and with connect to any of the above.
and ease into it by getting fiber for bussienss in charter,comcast or att , or verizon first.
still will pay cus paid for and go to dc then and do peering. the do startegic layouts for sat or wireless backhaul
go look at ix points and find smaller level 1 netowrks (aurelion) or a data center that doesnt offer me the ix but uses ix
so i can get closer.
