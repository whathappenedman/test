authorization vs authenticaiton

can use jwt for example:
removed admin role
change password/log outs 
near bottom fo this: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/

for admin role thats authR
will do in db?
for log outs just have a toggle in db or blacklist in memeory?
	crypto says what if that goes down. well so will my DB!



i think the main thing is avoiding a db lookup
this came up in the context of postgrest!
hn has comments

so session store check on every request into a db.
vs check signed token from client using key.
