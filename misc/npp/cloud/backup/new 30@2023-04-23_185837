4/23

after ramadan i had a few realizaitons:
imanan wahtisaban
do alot of zikr dua and always quran salah no matter your state.

---------------------------------
hanging out with ziyaad and harris i realized again that I need to live a basic life man
just having a job and fixing ear means i can travel and shit. just living a normie life is better
than my shit ass life

----------------------------------
i asked ziyaad to share his maps thing but he wouldnt but otoh he addedd me to his card for hertz insurance benefit
but otoh this is to avoid me staying extra nights on either end of the trip
also i asked for qamariya but he just avoided it in the group chat and obviosly harris doesnt care eihter.
he couldve at least offered to get us something.

-------------------------------------
omar said he wished i had my shit together so i couldve worked with him on his route planning thing
but he also said that we're not gonna be partners in passing when talking generically about the future and us working together

i was going to bring up us doing the cafes and then branching also into permaculture and resort/real estate
like i can be an executive. 
obviously we wont do 50/50 cus its his money. but at some point ill be adding in money too

as for conflict we can just brand 2 different ones and start with his but otherwise its performance metrics

but before i was going to bring this up he brought up the scaling guy from the coffee place.
so that discouraged me. 

anyways c level position with some equity.
i do manegrial work i can do foot work. it has to be worth it for you 
(but you also gotta have good will)
and like this is if you have 200k+ to invest on just this then we can bank roll it with riba


----------------------------------------------
your a shit (behind in life) person
so of course my friends treat me in my position.
it sucks cus i have that negative social standing from social when younger
but now its alsr the practical issue
cant fly, no money, no job, shit not toegther

and omars attitude doesnt seem like hes going to want to pull me up
but thats life bro, cant expect handouts.


-------------------------------------------------
keep journal on rpi.
