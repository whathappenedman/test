ai is coming end of world 1-2 years! max come on!!



i think i need a smaller screen?

if big screen need to sit back cus only one eye and dont want to move neck
then need to scale up text

thats what it is. if i had two eyes i could sit close and use a large/hi res display

need hight adjust table then monitor arm to desk
flexiport is cool

but on the other hand i sat moderatly close
not too close to need to move neck but close enough to see all with moving eyes
and i put it at 4k and 4 screens and it was doable
need to consider lighting, but probably like 1.25 at 4 is doable 
so idk whats the problem?
like as im typing this now im not gonna lie im starting to strain and
switch but how muuch of that also has to do with consistently looking down 
at kb?
and dont forgrt lighting

then theres the right eye overpowering issue

now im at 1.25 much better sitting back still moving neck?

man i think i do want a 22 inch screen hidpi
but isnt that my acer? that had white issue?


ok so i put my 4k 27 1.25
then put xpas display over it to get right scale
then 1.5xd it 
looked in sven
bascially get a 24 4k
put it at 1.25
then if needed 1.2 on text beyond that. but make screen smaller?

SITTING ALL THE WAY BACK IN SEAT AND PUTTING MONITOR BACK TOO AND
BLOWING UP TEXT ISNT BAD EITHER LIKE 180 ON WIKI
