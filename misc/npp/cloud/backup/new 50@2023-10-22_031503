Twillio Sendgrid immediatly closes accounts with the word Palestine in them

It was reported to me, and I confirmed, and so can you, by making a new account on sendgrid.com with an email such as plaestine@mydomain.com

Instead of a verification or welcome email you immediately get an account closure and violation of tos email.

Irrespective of the politics, such a crude filter is not a good look for Twillio who owns sendgrid. 

I did not check if this is the case on Twillio it self.
