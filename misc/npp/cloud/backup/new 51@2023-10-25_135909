lots of dummy side projects
main guy is here
1 to start
and team in india for research and support
can send all hardware there too

start on sides
and also prototypes to nail 
the usability and ui and process
can be un optimized at first 
will eventaully move to full open core/secure later

secure keyboard
all iot
	camera
	access pad
	car

first make authenticator
	basic screen and touch for keypad
	only few buttons like 2-5
	maybe just dpad?
	
	its for encrypted access
	like requester identifies and send nonce
	so mitm impractical cus first local
	second only for that machine and at that instant
	and only once
	couterpart has secure connection to main server
	with all keys and ui
		so door/building
		office/house
		really try for car
	---------------------------------------------can sell this right away for alot of money
	---------------------------------------------and no legal issues. can even sell to ems/pd
	---------------------------------------------aim for 1month if not 1 week.
	---------------------------------------------
	then for login like yubikey
	
	STEP 2
	key holder for appliances?
		keybboard
		ENCRYPTOR

		
also now make ptp ENCRYPTOR
	standalone and built and combo for ab
	
also there is the secure muxer thing to handle kvm basically?

all this is prototype 
as figuring it out and making it work 
now make sure its tamper proof
now switch to our own full hardware/open core

befoer this can start calls/messages/walkie taki/mic
add a basic offline maps and gps(try for inertial)
look into driving into hud/vr
basic custom apps

now look into mesh networking

later just add rdp/remote outofband pikvm sessions

maybe start with esp32?
https://deepbluembedded.com/esp32-sleep-modes-power-consumption/

stm 32 is better maybe


using 20000mah batter
20*3.7=74wh
74/3.5 for iphone 14
/5v for esp32
4228mah
/2 for smallish generic battery size and accouint for board extras
2114

@ .8 thats 2642hrs
light sleep
1ms resume
clock gate/keeps cpu state


deep sleep wakes from gpio/periph needs to restart cpu 150uA
hibernate wake from button lets say or timer 5uA

with button at night and (5ua)
and no movement for 5+ min for deep sleep (no accelermoeter)
14hrs+10hrs 
17616 days @ 5uA
587 days @150uA
tbh can probably get it to 1yr

but flipper zero is similar size(2kmah) battery and it gets 1 month??

make a universale remote thing
like wifi/ble/ir
but also rfid?
