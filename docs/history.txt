29 y/o male
history of covid related Pulmonary Embolism and covid pnemonia

I went to the ER in Dec 2021 a few times with covid. 
First time they took an x-ray and gave me regeneron(monoclonal-antibodies) and said I had lung infiltrartes and penmonia
Few days after i took the regeneron I got a pulmonary embolism. Went the the ER complaining of sharp pain upon inhaling.
They took the first ct then.
I was sent home with blood thinners and the P.E. resolved in time.

Few months ago I started feeling some slight and intermittent pain in my lower left lung.
The doctor sent me for a ct. this is the ct from 7/15/22 they found 2 nodules in the lower right lobe.
Then I was sent for PET/CT on 8/11 and there was no radioactive glucose uptake in the lungs but they found the nodules again and said they grew? 
But this time they referred to it as one "nodularity". 

Im thinking this is all related to the P.E, but am very confused and conerned.
As a layperson, looking at the second CT it seems clear as to what was noticed (two nodules lower lobe). 
Its harder to see on the latest CT. And on the first CT(the one from the ER) it looks like the same area had alot of acitivity as well.
Looking at all three sets, can you say that this nodularity is most likely related the the P.E. AND its not something to worry about?
Otherwise, please advise as to what you think it may be and what to do?
