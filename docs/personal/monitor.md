so at 125% scaling:
i am sitting hunched with my head into the monitor
liek the focus is on the bottom left (the side my face is goign into and body)
and everythign looks great
i can even view out the edges but i have to move head/neck
im sitting 18 inches out.
since looking at the bottom (hunched eye level) is comfy
i need mad height for good posture?
yea def want 2nd/5th at center of eye level
prolly want screen to be off to my right so im facing its left side so i use right eye only no glasses?

then i raised the height, tucked my seat in and sat upright not leaning on chair, monitor off center left (24 inches prolly away)
and things look and feel good too, just need to lower desk and further raise monitor for arms.
dont need arms on chair
