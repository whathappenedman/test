# Future

get hba pcie not sata expander
it is said expanders are unreliable
can get hot swap too with sas ports
lsi 16i or 8i (internal or e for external)

can buy 846 supermicro
or get a shelf.
but that is once i  have a normal nas filled with 10 drives.

cus the cost of the upgrade to 24 is min
500 chasis, 200 hba maybe x2
so like 1g. also fans, new psu?

then drives right so like
12 x 200 min is like 2500 so like min 5k budget
to jump past filling up to 10
5 default and then the 3x5.25 -> 5x3.5 hot swap (just cus easy to replace, stil power off)
so i have 3 maybe ill add 1.
after job add 6, so 1.2k
then reasses. 5k is alot lol 
some guy say qnap 2480

going shelf option or qnap option is interesting
and u want a pdu with web gui (smart power strip but also delivery)
basically u want 30 amp but iof not still liek a half rack
with power monitoring
