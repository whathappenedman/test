12 MAX
switch
$53 12 port x2
$252 to mmanage

ip
upolink ($42)

ws (60)
was (107)
db (64*4+107)
managemnt server/internal service server

add $22 for dual to everything +6 for wires
so 30

53*2
130 ws 2 * 60+42+28 
135 was 3 * 107+28
391 db 3 * 64*4+107+28
110 manage 2 * 40+28+(42/2)
277 back up 1 * (207+42+28)

2 switches (unmanaged)
1ws/rotuer with internet into each
other two tieres of servers one each into switch

ask about 12switch
samrt?
can ahve on server 10gbps uplink
and other 10gbps lan?

3.5k (20gbps)
2.5 1.5k
5k 2.7
2k (can be 400 only prt)
1k

so basically 40k for 2 locs assuming bandwith share
maybe even 30 if cut off the data from top (save 7k total with heztner discount compare prollyu 30k)
its 5x which is okay but at least not 10x.
then can cut even that in half by colo for db or buuyt ransit

fmt sucks 
try lax,dalas,chi,ash

come out to like 3ish
x2 so 6
then add 800tb usage @1
all comes to less than 10k

once making that
then move to 
datapacket

and to he
and look at other colo
get AS
look into peering and bgp

this whoel thing acutally

just go for hetzner cloud first to validate
linode is better disk ioops? (db)
and anyways still aiming for everything on cloud for launch anyways.
cloud 
	-> hetzner cloud -> hetzner dedi -> ovh
									 -> 10gbps
									 -> colo
for colo he fremont sucks. need to find providors and hardware loans

hetzner cloud:
2x LOCATIONS {
2x 4vcpu as nginx/node ($25/ea)
1x 8vcpu as db ($50ea)
	240bg * .7 / 6MB/user = 30k users
} TOTAL: $200
can add db when need for note
50 x 2 or 100 x2 or 100 x4
shard on user. no hash, just go seqential
deal with multi/public later
	?cache on nginx level for public
	?redis before db on node server

pg pool/ pg bouncer
db replictoiion
can deal with replication delay nbd
or do 2 pahse commit
verify:
on update trigger timestamp
on update call notify 
have long poll/ws in nginx/node for "registered" clients/users
simpliest is ask user to requery.

search: post gres real time using notify and long polling node js

do a check if on primary or other location when notify
if secondary just tell client to wait a second.
