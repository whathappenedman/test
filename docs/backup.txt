git add -u
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin master 

make that a .bat
and task schedule it every 5 min?

then git ignore
desktop .txt
p ignore node modules fml so noob

what happens if no changes does it error? error notify?
okay thats on way back up what about sync?

okay so acronis is an option
large files in back blaze?
like desktop -> nas
then speciifc nas folders zip and encrypted (file level) -> bb and glacier s3
one sys prep windows image too i guess


so symlink everything to a directory
2 folders, one for back up, other for 2way sync
back up is like game saves, sonarr ,large downloads 
this just goes rsync,clone to nas then cloud

sync stuff just goes to git, then also back up? 
idk
