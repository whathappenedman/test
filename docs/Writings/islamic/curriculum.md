semester system (2 semesters a year) (16 week semster) (3 courses per semester)
each course has:
-  one or two 1-1.5hr lecture a week
- one 1-2hr discussion (reading/hwk/activity)
some classes are twice a week, discussion only once.
-------------------------------------------------------------
i added some estimates so you can get an idea for how many weeks are spent on a topic.
and it college level.
there is some basic reading level requirements.
all in all it works out to 1 class of 1-1.5hr a day 4-5 days a week
like from your 3 classes its 2,2,1 or 1,2,1

islam fundamentals 1a
 - what is islam/6pillars/5pillars/basic hisotry/concept (2 weeks)
- basics of usul (high level quran->sunnah->ijma) (2 weeks)
- basic usul/logic (qatai zanni, induction, deduction) (2 weeks)
- basic aqeedah (allah,taqwa,yaqeen,) iman, doj death (4)
- dua/rizq (2)
- ethics (justice/zulm/ihsan sadaqah) (4 weeks)

islam fundamentals 1b
 - ihsan (tazkiyatunafs) (6)
- ashari/athari in detail (4)
- 4 schools (detail) (6)

quran 1a/1b
i dont know how to apporach this yet. i need to study the quran first my self lol

seerah 1a/1b
cover all seerah in 1yr basically improved but also condensed yq
so at least 64hr in class and more outside (you have to read/video/audio before class. like its gonna be new stuff in class not repeat of readings)
yq was 104 classes at 1hr 15 min roughly thats 130 hours.
if i streamline it and also make some parts outside readings thats should be easy to add more and fit it all in
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
islamic fundamentals 2a
practical personal fiqh

islamic fundamentals 2b
isims (ustaads class)
like politics and modernism and attitude to science

quran 2a/2b

history 1a
khilafah
history 1b
other sahabas lives and some major figures in islam

----------------------------------------------------------------------

this is roughly it.
like it can definitly be expanded to be 3 or 4 year. jusst the same topics but yea
this is enough.
but to be clear before the get to the khilafah they have spent 2-300hrs learning
I really do think that is enough to not be dangerous/negligent.
maybe its too short and im missing things but this is what ive roughly had in my mind.
as i wrote it out i realized its not just an islam 101 and 102. its pretty rigourus 2 years. maybe ill make it 3. to make it a little less rough.

obviously when one actually sits down to do the work of making the curriculum but also teaching it you might realize ive oversimplified it. but on the other had asking this much from working professionals is low key already alot.

there also would be a test to start the second year. and there would be a test to start the first year too but we will still take anyone for the first year. if certain peoples reading comprehension/logic/grammer/iq is too low they wont be allowed to take the second year. cus i do realize this is very accelerated. those people would self select and drop out anyways after seeing the pacing of the first year.
this is how i envision it. and id make the curriculum in light of that.

i think the compilation of the info like i said all in one place is good in and of it self. other educators can use it as a reference to teach at other levels.

people cant teach like this because of fiances. its always a conflicting interest of making it rigorous or making money(not greed but survive) thats why i need money to do it right basically so i dont have to care about money.

i probably would make it three years cus it is a little rough for high school/college/or working prfessionals. if someone is doing full time intensive i can do this in 1 year. other wise yea i think 3 years. also i can add a little more stuff.
real world history and also chirsitan/judaism/prophets. then more quran and more practical fiqh
