# Notes
Generally should be in the format of prophetic khutbahs.
should be concise and straight to the point.
clear and powerful statements the evoke emotional response.
Always quote quran, alot! to speak to your point.
then can mention some detailed example thats practical.
each of these topics should be one khutbah
can pair with another or use second to go into on branch of it
basically make these blocks
and you do a build your own.
so pick a topic then pick x of many blocks
can mix and match beyond that
maybe make and abstract rubric per 6 month
and repeat the pattern
max 10+10+10.
first khutbah, second, salaah
have at least 45 seconds break for dua.
basically write 60 snippits (blocks on one topic, corresponding to 1 out of the two
khutbahs)
that covers half the year, then when u repeat its always fresh cus u mix and match
u add your own, or there is guest speaker

encourage a fast delivery style when doing the exhortations or boosters
always add in, sprinkele in statements wherevery u can for example:
talking about sins, be like brother dont get black dot on your heart!
the angels wont forget, your hand will testify.
say things like, what are you waiting for. wake up.
time is running out. but balance dont be always doom and gloom.


# Broad Themes
Where applicable always mention or weave into point:
examples of the previous peoples
tention/release
humilty/service/action
clean your heart, do tazkiyah
core: read the book, do the rituals
taharah: good smells, be clean
smiles, softness, charity, family
dua: is your wapon


# psa
maybe ther is a need to modify/add
about the major practicual issues facing people
family
	dysfunctional fmaily
		high conflict
		authortiatraian
		detached
		violence/drugs
personal
	addictions
	productivity/goals
	mental health
social/civic
	contribute to society
	build
	
no i dont think we need to modify
just every other week or so can mention it as a sub point
like in the broad themes thing. can have guest speakers do it
but best for lectrure
