quranic supremacy
so we do not like to restrict the quran with one off hadiths
or we will use the quran to open up from rerstrictive hadiths
we know hadith explains quran though

ahl bayt
quran refers to wives
hadith mubalha refers to the 5
this is an example for explaining.
seems like constricting too but this is compatible with logic
wives can be divorced, attribute is given later by marriage

la yamassuhu illal mutaharoon
in context qurans it refers to angels/metaphsycial.
need strong hadith to constric from here

living tradition and the collective tradition of fiqh is a weighty but lesser proof/explainer
otherise i think hanafi usul with some consideration for aml madinah
then fiqh tradition and hadith on equal merits and 
need to add back in hadith of sahabah in proper place within/between the fiqh/hadith

----------------------------------------

we dont exceptionalize the prophets behavior unless strong
like we take it as general.
hudaybiyah
but we can contextualize the wordings (jonathan brown)

taking non-msulim vistitors in masjid nabawi
gifts from non muslims
meal invitation form jewess
for the above three some say this was exceptional he was head of state
first not strong enough proof
second using quran to restrict using just your logic.
fail. this is backwards
using ayliyaa ayah. u r expandinig speculativley using logic to restrict.

---------------------------------------------
abu hanifa and malik on haram
hanifa says the verese of najs is only refers to hajj
its tight but he has literalistic reasoning. but its not restrictive
maliks is more he says all masjid fall under
shafiee and hanbal say just harams 
shafie says city of makkah too is included
using logic thats speculative cus you have counter proof

--------------------------------------------
quran doesnt misguide .. this is kufr? to think
you have to accept it and not be kaafir
i.e. be humble and have adab.
so come to it with logic and training if not following ahlzikr
the khawarig were arroant over ali and aal, and badris.
inlhukmu is counter to logic. the are brain dead. 
goes back to expanding speculativeley cus verse is ambigious/general/generic

read it and dont be hard headed. ask ahlzikr
---------------------------------------------
shia
u belive ali is better fine
you belive imamat, its lowkey kufr but we can deal
aisha is redline cus of noor:17
and so is cursing or working against the first 3
cus follow ur imam, he gave love and support
follow hasan, he chose peace AND GOOD FAITH even though he was right
so if you back off those 4 and might as well add talhah abd zubair based on
if the yaccept ali only making dua against muawaiyah
then we have a path forward to brother hood
we pray to makkah and we can eat ur zibh if we can eat chirsitians and marry
