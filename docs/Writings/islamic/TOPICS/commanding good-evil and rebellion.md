they say dont rebel
then they say command and enjoin
contradictory

hadith says for follow (context muawiya)
hadith says if you dont command then bad will rule and dua wont work
hadith says start punishment with the wali

so you have to hold rulers to account peacably.
failing this everything will collapse to despot.
cant stay silent.

rebellion cant be always haram (zayd ibn ali)
