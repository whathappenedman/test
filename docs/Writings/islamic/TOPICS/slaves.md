Whay does islam allow sex with slaves

Islam is for all times and places filled with divine wisdom
Islam came to restrict slavery
Islam came to restric sexual abuse and promiscuity
islam very strongly encourages freeing slaves
Islame strong ly regulates treatment and entrancer of slaves

without islam sexual promiscutiy is rampant
you can have sex with whoever you want as musch as you want
you can have sex work and slavery which is opressive

islam says restricts who you can have sex with
it says only wife and slaves

compare with moder pow or sex worker
compare with modern sexual ethics

islam gives rights to slaves
good treatment freedom from prostitution right to freedom contract

otherwise we have brutal treatment of slaves, sex workers, prisoners
no limits no hope, barbaric

islam puts society on a path away from slavery but acknowledges it may retturn
so it prescribes good treatment

today sexual/slavery is on the rise and at epidemic levels
with subhuman treat ment 
islam is the solution
