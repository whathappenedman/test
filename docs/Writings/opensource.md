some ideas

like there is no privacy respecting tool for
connecting all ur bank info

fund it my self with open commitment.
gpl2 at least
have os rules for my comitte

commit to min 20% of money goes to devs working on main (describe) product
salary caps for admin, exec staff as a percentage including
non-tech speicif over head. like 25%
so nontech isnt like licensing fees, or widevine

have commitment to open books.
and yearly meeting where voters are
people who donated 100 in year
or 1k last 10
with a ddos exemption
like if more than 100% yoy increase
we can unilaterally put conditions
and votes are still split 50 public 50 company
but some company .5-.33 votes are for devs. if unanimous has powerup


can also do auth and basic webserver docker/image
this way too
weather app ... etc
