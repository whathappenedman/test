cYAN voxel tag studio

attributes, multi tag
2 existing apps

uuid to tag and vice versa mapping
less than 1 mb in memory
16 byte uuid + varchar 5 bytes x 10 < 100bytes * 10k items < 1MB
probably also opposite too, so tag to uuid

dont really need heavy db and id love to just use an doc store or giant object
or json. with crdt? just keep in in sync with web sockets
but more simply first step what?
