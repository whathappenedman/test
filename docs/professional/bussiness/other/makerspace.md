get table top:
cnc router (2.5k 1finity)
laser cutter (orion)
2 3d printers
solder


wood working and other shit(10k)
    table saw 5k
    each atl east 500:
    dust,shopvac, orbital sander, other sander
    router, planner, circle saw, mitre saw, power tools, 
    grips, lathes, misc things
    few 1k cabinets
metal working gear?
20k lathe/mill/bench

all in all probably less than 30k for barebones.
10k for tabletop basics
10k for wood tools
10k misc for shop



later need filtration/electric
and larger cnc for 20k
and metal for 20k

so 100k all in? for basic full build out
can start smaller with 30k. then upgrade as needed
still 100k is less than one guys salary

you need a machinist they get hourly under 100k 
as low as 30 up to 40 an hour.
then can get a wood guy doo
so 2 trades guys
and one ee and one me
the ee makes the most so:
80+80+100+130
for skilled leaders:
100,120,150 so lets say 400k
so thats 30k. 1k per day!

25 wood (52k)
35 metal (72k)
me 92k
thats 216 ad ee at 140 thats 356 then bump a bit
so yea 400k
moonlight on custom jobs.
till grow and hire apprentances.
