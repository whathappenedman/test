# Must Have
crossplat/mobile/web 
TOC/outline
fileExplorer, fodlers, tags
export as plain md, images in dir?
sync
easy linking
embed images

# Contenders

# notes 
check obisidan for:
toc at least
and css for columns 

need sync.

joplin is cheaper af


# my app 
need tags and folders and FE
support links and embeds 
need columns and blocks and archiver.
need toc
collapsable hierarchy
pop up on hover, expand on click, open on side
password protect

blocks:
    links
    notes/scratch/shadow/inbox

yes its propietary
but to html and to seperate md
or append command in order.
but always exportable.

use html or css
but then need whole app for view and sync 
which tbh is pwa and couch? or even r2
there are ready to use keep clones online

reminders
agenda view
charge $8 fuck it. everyone else is.
how will i limit free?
premium trial for 90 days for $1 (get cc low friction) or mod days and price
then have a free plan just to demo so like 1-2 boards limited items in db
max 30 notes. no realtime sync

so make a keep(obsidian) part
wsiwyg/md with linking and embed.
then add blocks(collapse and move and columns)
this turns into a one note to trello thing
also has journal and shadown/scratch/links.
try and present it as oh you want "quick notes" or powered up notes
then add kanban and to do features as a seperate branch
can nest on in another. simple note cannot nest in side.
dont foget i have my tagging app too.
need to make a detailed survey, keep doing that
abstract it and then build and architech mine.
the preceding was a rough example
microsoft 365 has some adv clipper and also ai thing

built in unit calculator
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32493946
code notebook like jupyter. just support js and/or py
share note in an org
share a folder publically?
share them with password/ip/psk/expire
share notes after dead. can pay lifetime
in event of sunset. convert to static site:
domain reg payed for 100 years to 2 lawfirms.
host on multiple cloud/multiple email/twillio
https://weexpire.org/
https://waaard.com/?ref=show-hn

publishing too, like a blog. 

## Kanban
multi select
add at bottom
seperate rows
duplicate cards but same
card colors,tags,priority,date
task vs projects vs backlog
    task means i have concrete actionable steps forward
    project is unclear rn. need research/strategy/triage
look at kanban tool, can do my thing of disjoint rows
or swim lanes
collapsable columns/expand all/ select and collapse/collapse empty
sub cards with toggle, icon for has desc
recurring(every x thing. so bi weekly quarterly)
some formula thing
like add up values
for me its total of price for buy
can be time/difficulty estimate


have a kanban view
then an agenta/calander view
keep
journal
