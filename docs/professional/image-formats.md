jpeg, webp, avif


jpeg is globally supported avif is all current (as in updated) browsers, 
and web p is in all "modern" browsers. avif is still demanding ish, need to 
put some work in compute.

so just start with jpeg. in dev
for avif need to handle compute
for webp, may need to move on later and might not be as efficient
and still might not be able to ditch jpeg too?
webp is too young still (released 2018) to replace jpeg fallback
apple got it by sep 2020
so see what the compression delta is between web and avif
but also avif compute performace

but regardless it looks like jpeg and avif!
r2 and bunny are good for this? with b2 fall back for jpeg/fullsize
