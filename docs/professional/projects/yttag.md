so i want to support many "types" of data with many options.
yt vids is basic

but lets say hn, reddit or stack, or blog post or ref from website
save link and tag
but also snippets. how to do?

on desktop and mobile?
so ingest link first then archive/load it
then use snip in app ui? or if direct link just that part.
these are custom integartions then a generic one too?
so do hn first then stack then reddit?
